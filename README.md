# AI-chatbot-Application

This repository contains an AI-powered chatbot application built using Streamlit. The chatbot can answer both general queries and document-based queries. It leverages state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to provide accurate and context-aware responses.


#### Features

1. General Query Support: The chatbot can handle a wide range of questions based on general knowledge.
2. Document-Based Query Support: Users can upload documents, and the chatbot will provide relevant answers by retrieving and analyzing data from the uploaded files.
3. RAG Implementation: Incorporates Retrieval-Augmented Generation using LlamaIndex to handle external data sources effectively.
4. LLM Integration: Utilizes the powerful Llama 3 (8B) model deployed on Azure.
5. Embeddings: Uses an embedding model from Hugging Face for enhanced semantic search and document processing.


#### Technology Stack

1. Streamlit: Frontend framework for building an interactive and user-friendly web application.
2. Llama 3 (8B): Chosen LLM model for generating responses.
3. Azure: Cloud platform for hosting and deploying the Llama 3 model.
4. LlamaIndex: Facilitates the integration of external data into the chatbot responses.
5. Hugging Face: Provides embedding models for semantic understanding.
